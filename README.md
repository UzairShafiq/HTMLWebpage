Hey! I'm currently taking an online course on UDEMY to learn about web development. After learning HTML, I made this webpage to test my knowledge. I am now halfway through the CSS section of the course, and will be creating a new webpage using that knowledge soon. 

After learning the basics (HTML & CSS), the course dives into more advanced web development tools such as; Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap 4, PHP and more. I am excited to begin this journey of becoming a successful web developer, and am enjoying the learning process so far!
