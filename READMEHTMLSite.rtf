\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hey! This is my first webpage ever. I\'92m currently taking an online course on UDEMY to learn about web development. After learning HTML, I made this simple webpage to test my skills. I am now halfway through learning about CSS, and will update with webpage with that knowledge soon. Then, I will learn about PhP, Wordpress, and other web development tools. This is the beginning of my journey to becoming a good web developer!}
